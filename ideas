SiC: Simple Configuration Files
===============================

Goals:
1. A well-specified format
2. Not bound to a particular character encoding
3. As simple as INI in cases where INI could be used
4. Less confusing than YAML
5. Less noisy than JSON
6. Easy for a text editor to infer correct indentation
7. Syntax includes comments
8. Support for variables and substitution

Would also be nice:
1. A schema language

var=value
key: value
key:
  var2=this one is scoped
  nested: $var2
  nested:
    * list item
    * another list $var item
    * a third list item
    * nested: dict in a list
    * * nested list
      * second item in nested list
    * * * whoa
        * another
      * different depth
key: "quoted value $var"
"quoted key": "please don't"
'other quotes': 'why not?'


SO WHAT ARE THE RULES?

The top-level is a dictionary.

A dictionary consists of key-value pairs and variable bindings.

A variable binding is always a single line.

A scalar value may originate from multiple tokens, in which case it is the
values of all those tokens, joined with a single space between each adjacent
pair. Each quoted scalar evaluates to a single scalar token.

If a key-value pair has no value on the first line, then its value is either:
  * A nested dictionary, if the next line is indented and starts with a key
  * A nested list, if the next line is indented and starts with an asterisk
  * A scalar, if the next line is indented
  * Empty, if the next line is not indented
  * An error, otherwise

The type of a list item is determined by what follows the asterisk on the *same* line:
  * A nested dictionary, if there is a key
  * A nested list, if there is another asterisk (further items in that list
    come on subsequent lines, with their asterisks indented to match that of
    the first)
  * A scalar, otherwise


SCHEMAS

Without a schema, all scalars are interpreted as strings. A schema can require
both a particular structure of dictionaries and lists, as well as rules and
interpretations for scalars.
